            What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House
            Quidditch team because he hadnâ€™t practiced all summer? What was it
            to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his
            homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a
            drop of magical blood in their veins).
